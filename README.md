# networks-in-conflict

## Introduction
This project for a replication exercise for the political economy sequence at UC Berkeley.
It attempts to replicate the paper Michael D. KÃ¶nig, Dominic Rohner, Mathias Thoenig, Fabrizio Zilibotti (2017): **"Networks in Conflict: Theory and Evidence from the Great War of Africa"**, published in _Econometrica_ 85(4): p. 1093-1132. 

In addition, it implements two extensions of the paper.
